To use the widget set below, you can use two methods to install:
1. Install with installer script (Tested on gnome)
2. Manual confinement (recomended)

I propose the second method (manual configurations)

Note: First of all, make sure the conky-manager is installed

The first method:
Run the installer script

The second method:

1.Download the whole repository and Install fonts inside the fonts folder

Copy the victorConky folder to this path

~/.conky 

now you can choos your favorite conky from conky-manager software
